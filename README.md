# FirebaseInAppMessaging

Firebase In-App Messaging helps you engage your app's active users by sending them targeted, contextual messages that encourage them to use key app features. For example, you could send an in-app message to get users to subscribe, watch a video, complete a level, or buy an item. You can customize messages as cards, banners, modals, or images, and set up triggers so that they appear exactly when they'd benefit your users most.

Use Firebase In-App Messaging to encourage exploration and discovery: highlight a sale or coupon in your ecommerce app, give clues or tips in your game, or prompt a like or share in your social media app.
